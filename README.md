# InstaCart-Market-Basket-Analysis

This is a machine learning project in which I used Xg boost in R to predict what the user will buy.
The Prediction features are-
curr_prod_purchased,
product_id,
user_total_products_ordered_hist, 
uniq_prod, 
uniq_aisle,
uniq_dept,
prior_orders,
prior_prod_cnt,
last_purchased_orders_ago
first_purchased_orders_ago,


The output result is-
Current Purchased Orders


The accuracy of the model is 90%
I have used Classification to solve the problem

For the data I took a sample of 1000.The train set consists of the data marked as trained
and the test set as the data marked as test.
